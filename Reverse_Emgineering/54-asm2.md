## Goal
What does asm2(0xb,0x2e) return? Submit the flag as a hexadecimal value (starting with '0x'). NOTE: Your submission for this question will NOT be in the normal flag format. [Source](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/717467c8c8b4332ea5873ad8fe7b2dad/test.S)
## Hints
+ assembly [conditions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/assembly_conditions.htm)

## Solution
STACK 

 [] < ESP
 [] < EBP - 0xc
 [0xb] < EBP - 0x8
 ['-0xffffff75'] < EBP - 0x4
[EBP] < EBP
[RET] < EBP + 0x4
[0xb] < EBP + 0x8
[0x2e] < EBP + 0xc

REGISTERS
[0x2e]EAX ; 1
[0xb]EAX ; 2

asm2: (0xb,0x2e)
	<+0>:	push   ebp
	<+1>:	mov    ebp,esp
	
	<+3>:	sub    esp,0x10
	<+6>:	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc]
	<+9>:	mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4],eax
	<+12>:	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]
	<+15>:	mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x8],eax
	<+18>:	jmp    0x509 <asm2+28>
	<+20>:	add    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4],0x1
	<+24>:	sub    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x8],0xffffff80
	<+28>:	cmp    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x8],0x63f3
	<+35>:	jle    0x501 <asm2+20>
	<+37>:	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4]
	
	<+40>:	leave  
	<+41>:	ret    


<+6>: mov eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc].
Store what we have in [ebp+0xc] in EAX

<+9>: mov DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4],eax
We store what we have in EAX in the address [ebp-0x4].

<+12>: mov eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8].
Whatever you have in this address [ebp+0x8], is going to be stored in EAX.

<+15>: mov DWORD PTR [ebp-0x8],eax
What we have in EAX we store in the address [ebp-0x8].

<+18>: jmp 0x509 <asm2+28>: jmp 0x509 <asm2+28>
Jump to line 28

<+28>: cmp DWORD PTR [ebp-0x8],0x63f3
0xb <= 0x63f3
True
We compare what we have in the address [ebp-0x8] with 0x63f3

<+35>: jle 0x501 <asm2+20>
Jump to line 20

<+20>: add DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4],0x1
 hex(0x2e+1)
'0x2f'
Add what we have in the address [ebp-0x4] with 0x1

<+24>: sub DWORD PTR [ebp-0x8],0xffffffff80

Subtract 0xffffffffff80 from whatever we have in [ebp-0x8].
 hex(0xb-0xffffffffff80)
'-0xffffffffff75'

<+28>: cmp DWORD PTR [ebp-0x8],0x63f3
-0xffffffffff75 <= 0x63f3

+ It will always be generating a loop, because we are doing a subtraction of 0xffffffff80 to [ebp-0x8] and a comparison [ebp-0x8] with 0x63f3.
+ What we should do is to add 0x80(128) to [ebp-0x8], instead of subtracting.
+ We can do this in a python script, using decimal values:
0xb => 11
0x2e => 46
0x63f3=>25587

>>> a = 46
>>> b = 11
>>> while b <= 25587:
... a += 1
...     b += 128
...
>>> print(a)
246
>>> hex(a)
'0xf6'
>>>
This is the flag
'0xf6'
