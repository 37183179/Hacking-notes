## Goal

Can you find the robots? `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:56830

## Solution

+ Open the link
+ In the link address add the word robots.txt
  "https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/robots.txt"
+ I was redirected to another page
+ On that page it gave me some extra information:
  1bb4c.html
+ I added that one replacing robots.txt by 1bb4c.html

## Notes

A robots.txt file is a special text file on a website that tells web robots, like search engine crawlers, which parts of the website they are allowed to access and which parts they should not. It's like a set of instructions for robots, guiding them on what they can and cannot see on the website.

- **Purpose:** It helps website owners control how search engines and other bots crawl and index their website.
- **Functionality:** It doesn't completely block access, but rather provides recommendations that most well-behaved robots follow.
- **Benefits:** It can be used to prevent unimportant pages or resources from being crawled, which can help improve website performance and efficiency.
- **Limitations:** It's important to remember that robots.txt relies on voluntary compliance, so malicious bots may still ignore these instructions.
