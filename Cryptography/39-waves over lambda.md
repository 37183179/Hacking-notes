## Goal
We made a lot of substitutions to encrypt this. Can you decrypt it? Connect with `nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 39894`.

## Solution

+ Enter this command to initiate a connection: nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 39894
+ The connection gave me a string 
+ The string is using a substitution cipher.
+ I searched the internet for a substitution cipher.
+ With [substitution-solver](https://www.guballa.de/substitution-solver) I pasted the string and it gave me the text.

we were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship till we saw her sink, and then I understood for the first time what it meant for a ship to be wrecked at sea. I must own that I had scarcely eyes to look up when the sailors told me she was sinking; for from the moment I was rather put into the boat than could be said to go in, my heart was, as if dead within me, partly from fright, partly from the horror of my mind, and from the thoughts of what was still before me.
